# logrus

A collection of random utility functions. Nothing in here is all that special,
they're just yet another implementation of functions I've rewritten at every
job to use in various utility scripts. By open sourcing them now, I'm hoping to
not have to write them again.

Everything here is Apache 2.0 licensed.
