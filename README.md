# logrus

The logrus is a collection of random utility functions. Nothing in here
is all that special, they're just yet another implementation of functions
I've rewritten at every job to use in various utility scripts. By open
sourcing them now, I'm hoping to not have to write them again.

## Installation

`pip install logrus`
