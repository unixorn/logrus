def findSubCommand(args):
  """
  Given a list ['foo','bar', 'baz'], attempts to create a command name in the
  format 'foo-bar-baz'. If that command exists, we run it. If it doesn't, we
  check to see if foo-bar exists, in which case we run `foo-bar baz`. We keep
  taking chunks off the end of the command name and adding them to the argument
  list until we find a valid command name we can run.

  This allows us to easily make git-style command drivers where for example we
  have a driver script, foo, and subcommand scripts foo-bar and foo-baz, and when
  the user types `foo bar foobar` we find the foo-bar script and run it as
  `foo-bar foobar`

  # driver script itself and re-executing it will cause an infinite loop, so
  # don't even look at the first element on its own.
